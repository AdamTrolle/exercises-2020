# Problem set 1

In the first problem set we will take a look at solving the classical utility maximization problem for the consumers.  

__PROBLEM SET STRUCTURE:__  
Each problem set consist of an exercise notebook and a solution notebook. You should take a look at the exercise notebook, and really try to solve the issue yourself. 

__MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS:__  
Within the field programming an numerical analysis there is at far most times more than one way of solving a problem. So the solution provided in the solution notebook is only one of many ways of solving the problem(s).

__EXTRA PROBLEM:__  
The solution notebook will not include solutions to exercises prefixed with _Extra Problem_ but we encourage you to take a look on these exercises. If, you solve these exercises please let us know and we will share your solution at [numeconcopenhagen.netlify.com](https://numeconcopenhagen.netlify.com) where you will be credited for the solution.
